Here you'll find the merge sort code for both integer sorting as well as string sorting.

The merge sort for integers takes the array of random numbers and sends them to a function where a while loop runs to split the array in half and ultimately determine if the incoming number is higher or lower than the previous entry. Therefore, it is using the divde and conquer technique.

The merge sort for the string takes the inputed string and using a similar divide and conquer technique analyzes the first letter of the incoming string array(AKA array at position 0) and from that point places them in alphabetical order.

Thank you for finding my merge sort code :))
